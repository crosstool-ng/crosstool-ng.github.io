title: Setting up host OS
permalink: /docs/os-setup/

This section describes the setup needed by various operating systems
in order to run crosstool-NG, as well as some OS-specific caveats and limitations.
The package lists given in the following subsections cover all the features tested
by the sample configurations. You particular configuration may not need all those
packages. For example, `git` is needed if your configuration is for an uClinux-based
target which requires `elf2flt` utilities (which does "rolling releases" and must
be checked out from a Git repository).

If on the other hand you encounter a dependency not listed here, please let us
know over the mailing list or via a pull request!

Linux: ArchLinux
----------------

The following packages are needed for crosstool-NG (assuming `pacstrap ... base base-devel`
and `pacman -S grub os-prober` were performed during installation): `git help2man python gperf`.
Install them with `pacman -S PACKAGES`.

**Notes**

1. The default color scheme used by Kconfig on ArchLinux makes the active menu selection
   hard to see. A workaround for this issue is to put the following line into your shell's
   profile (e.g. `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc` for bash):
````
export MENUCONFIG_COLOR=mono
````

Linux: CentOS
-------------

The following packages need to be installed on CentOS 7:
````
yum install autoconf gperf bison flex texinfo help2man gcc-c++ patch \
	ncurses-devel python-devel perl-Thread-Queue bzip2 git
````

Linux: Fedora Core
------------------

The following packages need to be installed on Fedora Core 25:
````
dnf install autoconf gperf bison flex texinfo help2man gcc-c++ patch \
	ncurses-devel python-devel perl-Thread-Queue git
````

Linux: Gentoo
-------------

The following packages need to be installed after installing a minimal profile:
````
emerge dev-vcs/git
````

Linux: Ubuntu
-------------

The following packages need to be installed on Ubuntu 16.04.2 (server):

````
apt-get install gcc gperf bison flex texinfo help2man make libncurses5-dev \
	python-dev
````

macOS (a.k.a Mac OS X, OS X)
----------------------------

*Originally contributed by: Titus von Boxberg*

The instructions below have been verified on macOS Sierra (10.12). They have been previously
reported to work with versions since Mac OS X Snow Leopard (10.6) with Developer Tools 3.2,
and with Mac OS X Leopard (10.5) with Developer Tools + GCC 4.3 or newer installed via MacPorts.

1. You have to use a case sensitive file system for crosstool-NG's build and target
   directories. Use a disk or disk image with a case sensitive FS that you
   mount somewhere.

2. Install required tools via HomeBrew. The following set is sufficient for
   HomeBrew: `autoconf binutils gawk gmp gnu-sed help2man mpfr openssl pcre readline wget xz`.
   Install them using `brew install PACKAGE` command.

   Also, installing `homebrew/dupes/grep` is recommended. It has been noticed that GNU libc
   was misconfigured due to a subtle difference between BSD grep (which is used by macOS) and
   GNU grep. This has since been fixed, but other scripts in various packages may still contain
   GNUisms.

   If you prefer to use MacPorts, refer to the previous version of the instruction below
   and let us know if it works with current crosstool-NG and macOS releases.

**Notes:**

1. When building on macOS, the following message may be displayed:

   ````
clang: error: unsupported option '-print-multi-os-directory'
clang: error: no input files
   ````

   It is reported when the host version of `libiberty` (from GCC) is compiled by macOS
   default compiler, `clang`. In absense of any reported multilib information, `libiberty`
   is then configured with the default compilation flags. This does not seem to affect
   the resulting toolchain.

2. `ct-ng menuconfig` will not work on Snow Leopard 10.6.3 since libncurses
   is broken with this release. MacOS <= 10.6.2 and >= 10.6.4 are ok.

Windows: Cygwin
---------------

*Originally contributed by: Ray Donnelly*

Prerequisites and instructions for using crosstool-NG for building a cross
toolchain on Windows (Cygwin) as build and, optionally Windows (hereafter)
MinGW-w64 as host.

1. Use Cygwin64 if you can. DLL base-address problems are lessened that
   way and if you bought a 64-bit CPU, you may as well use it.

2. You must enable Case Sensitivity in the Windows Kernel (this is only really
   necessary for Linux targets, but at present, crosstool-ng refuses to operate
   on case insensitive filesystems). The registry key for this is:
   `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\kernel\obcaseinsensitive`
   Read more [here](https://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using-specialnames.html).

   Since release 1.7, Cygwin no longer supports the 'managed' mount option.
   You must use case sensitive FS.

3. Using `setup.exe` or `setup-x86_64.exe`, install the default packages and also
   the following ones:
<!-- TBD in a clean win install, check which ones are selected by default -->
   - autoconf
   - automake
   - bison
   - diffutils
   - flex
   - gawk
   - gcc-g++
   - git
   - gperf
   - help2man
   - libncurses-devel
   - make
   - patch
   - python-devel
   - texinfo
   - wget
   - xz
   Leave "Select required packages (RECOMMENDED)" ticked.

   Notes:
   - The packages marked with * are only needed if your host is MinGW-w64.

4. Although nativestrict symlinks seem like the best idea, extracting glibc fails
   when they are enabled, so just don't set anything here. If your host is MinGW-w64
   then these 'Cygwin-special' symlinks won't work, but you can dereference them by
   using tar options --dereference and --hard-dereference when making a final tarball.
   I plan to investigate and fix or at least work around the extraction problem.
   Read more [here](https://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using-cygwinenv.html).

5. If both BFD and GOLD linkers are enabled in binutils, `collect2.exe` will attempt
   to run `ld` which is a shell script so you need to make sure that a working shell
   is in your path.  Eventually this will be replaced with a native program for
   MinGW-w64 host.

**Notes**

1. Cygwin is slow. No, really, really slow. Expect about approximately 5x to 10x slowdown
   compared to a Linux system.

FreeBSD (and other BSD)
-----------------------

FreeBSD support is currently experimental in crosstool-NG.

FreeBSD does not provide a `gcc` command by default. Crosstool-NG and many of the packages
used expect this by default. A comprehensive fix for various ways of setting up the OS
is planned after the 1.23 release. Until then, setting up the following packages is
recommended as a prerequisite for crosstool-NG:

- `archivers/zip`
- `devel/automake`
- `devel/bison`
- `devel/gettext-tools`
- `devel/git`
- `devel/gmake`
- `devel/gperf`
- `devel/libatomic_ops`
- `devel/libtool`
- `devel/patch`
- `lang/gcc6`
- `lang/gawk`
- `misc/help2man`
- `print/texinfo`
- `textproc/asciidoc`
- `textproc/gsed`
- `textproc/xmlto`

Use any supported method of installation, e.g.:
````
cd /usr/ports/lang/gcc6
make install clean
````

Even with these packages installed, some of the samples are failing to build. YMMV.
